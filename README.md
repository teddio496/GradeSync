Grade Sync is a user-friendly web application that helps students manage their grades. The app provides an intuitive interface for entering, editing, and calculating grades, allowing users to track their performance in different courses effortlessly.

I used to use spreadsheets to manage my course grades and grade estimation, however, I found that experience was getting more painful as I took more courses, so I created this app to simplify that process.
